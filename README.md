A grip of scripts that make shit easier by Panther Modern

## Get Started

Okay! First, before you download these scripts. You need the following:
  *- Python* - A coding langauge used to run/create programs
  *- FFMPEG* - Open Source Library for manipulating media files

Here are beginner friendly instructions on HOW to INSTALL both:

## FFMPEG

### Installing the precompiled version of FFmpeg on Mac:

  1. Download the precompiled package of FFmpeg for Mac from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
  2. Double-click on the downloaded package to extract its contents.
  3. Drag the extracted FFmpeg application to the "Applications" folder.
  4. Once the FFmpeg application is installed, you can verify the installation by opening Terminal and running the following command: "ffmpeg      -version".

### Installing the precompiled version of FFmpeg on Windows:

  1. Download the precompiled package of FFmpeg for Windows from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
  2. Double-click on the downloaded package to extract its contents.
  3. Move the extracted FFmpeg folder to a location of your choice (e.g., C:\ffmpeg).
  4. Add the path to the FFmpeg bin directory (e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin) to your system's PATH environment variable (as described in the previous        instructions).
  5. Open the Command Prompt (press Windows key + X, and select "Command Prompt").
  6. Run the following command to verify the installation: "ffmpeg -version".
  7. If the installation is successful, you should see the version information for FFmpeg.

## PYTHON

### Installing Python on Mac:

1. Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Mac.
2. Double-click the downloaded package to begin the installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening Terminal and running the following command: "python3 --version".

### Installing Python on Windows:

1. Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
2. Double-click the downloaded package to begin the installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening the Command Prompt (press Windows key + X, and select "Command Prompt") and running the following command: "python --version".

*Note: Make sure to select the option to add Python to your PATH environment variable during the installation process on Windows, so that you can run Python from the Command Prompt.*

 ## Installing and Running Meow App on MAC

1. Make sure you have Python and FFMPEG installed on your Mac. If you don't have it installed, follow the instructions I provided earlier on  how to install Python on Mac.
2. Open "Finder" on your Mac.
3. Click on the "Applications" folder.
4. Scroll down and find the "Utilities" folder.
5. Double-click on the "Terminal" application to open it.
6. Go to the MEOW repository on GitHub (https://github.com/<username>/MEOW).
7. Click the "Clone or download" button and select "Download ZIP".
8. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice on your computer.
9. In Terminal, type "cd" followed by a space, then drag the MEOW folder from Finder into the Terminal window and press Enter.
10. Run the following command to install the required dependencies: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
11. Run the following command to run the MEOW script: "python meow_app.py"

*Note: The above steps assume that you have Git and pip (Python package manager) installed on your Mac. If you don't have them installed, you'll need to install them first.*
